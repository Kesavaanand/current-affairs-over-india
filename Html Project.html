    <h2 class="heading-blue">1.<span>I</span>nvestigative <span>N</span>ews:</h2>
    <h3>A.Ex-RAW agent with shocking US charges of <mark>Pannun murder plot was arrested by Delhi Police:</mark></h3>
        <p>A former Indian government official charged in the United States this week for allegedly directing a foiled murder plot had been arrested in New Delhi in December in an attempted murder case, according to court records and a police officer.
            The U.S. Justice Department unsealed the indictment of39, on Thursday, alleging he led a plot to murder a Khalistani separatist in New York.
            From May 2023, the U.S. indictment alleges, Yadav, described as an Indian government employee at the time, worked with others in India and abroad to direct a plot to kill Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, a dual U.S.-Canadian citizen.
            <mark>Delhi Police had arrested Yadav on Dec. 18</mark> the Indian capital, the police officer told on condition of anonymity. Yadav and an associate were charged with attempted murder and other crimes, according to a filling in a delhi district court.
            <mark>Yadav's lawyer, R.K. Handoo</mark>, called the Indian charges "fallacious", adding there was "an international plot to bring shame on the government of India and my client".
            Handoo declined to comment further.
            He and the police did not respond to questions on Yadav's whereabouts. The Washington Post, citing American officials, reported on Thursday that Yadav was still in India and that the U.S. was expected to seek his extradition.
            Yadav's arrest was based on a complaint by an Indian businessman, who alleged Yadav and an associate kidnapped him in December, assaulted and robbed him, according to details in a Delhi district court order dated Feb23.
            "The accused persons tortured and manhandled the complainant and demanded money in the name of gangster Lawrence Bishnoi," said the Feb. 23 court order, summarising the complaint.
            <mark>Bishnoi, in jail in India's Gujarat state</mark>, is an organised crime gang leader, according to India's National Investigation Agency. Bishnoi's lawyer says he is contesting more than 40 cases on charges including murder and extortion, with many trials yet to begin.

        <h3>B.India targeting high-profile journalists with <mark>spyware Amnesty:</mark></h3> 
        <p>A report has surfaced indicating that Pegasus spyware continues to be used to target various individuals, including journalists and activists in India.
        The forensic analysis conducted by organizations like Amnesty International reveals alarming instances of cyber surveillance, prompting calls for greater transparency regarding the use of such technologies by the governmentâ€‹.
        The Indian government has been allegedly using Pegasus spyware to target prominent journalists, as per a joint investigation released on Thursday by Amnesty International and The Washington Post.
        Pegasus software, developed by the <mark>Israeli company NSO Group</mark> and distributed to governments worldwide, allows users to read and write on a phone, browse through images, record calls, monitor locations, and even record the owner using the camera.
        According to Amnesty International, the most recent case of the malware on the iPhones of journalists Siddharth Varadarajan of The Wire and Anand Mangnale of The Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project was discovered in October.
        "Our latest findings show that increasingly, journalists in India face the threat of unlawful surveillance simply for doing their jobs, alongside other tools of repression including imprisonment under draconian laws, smear campaigns, harassment, and intimidation," said Donncha O Cearbhaill, Head of Amnesty International's Security Lab.
        Representing the Indian government <mark>MeitY's Rajeev Chandrasekhar</mark> on social media platform X (formerly Twitter) said that the response has been consistent. "My response to this incident has been consistent and clear from the incident - That it is for Apple to explain if their devices are vulnerable and what triggered these notifications. Apple was asked to join the enquiry with CERT-In and meetings have been held and enquiry is ongoing," he said.
        Last month, Indian media reported that the nation's cyber security unit CERT-In was looking into claims made by opposition lawmakers that they were subjected to attempted phone tapping. These politicians had received alerts from Apple about "state-sponsored attackers" on their iPhones.
        <mark>Minister of communication and technology, Ashwini Vaishnaw</mark>, stated that the government was "concerned" about the grievances.

    <h3>Modi govt systematically throttling <mark>MGNREGA Jairam Ramesh:</mark></h3>
    <p><mark>Congress leader Jairam Ramesh</mark> on Saturday accused the Modi government of "systematically throttling" MGNREGA, and demanded a hike in its budget as it is the "lifeline" of crores of India's poorest communities.

        "MGNREGA - the lifeline of crores of India's poorest communities - is being systematically throttled by the non-biological PM's government.
        
        "Budget allocations are being cut relentlessly, and wage rates have been stagnant. Now, through an ill-conceived reliance on technology, workers are being denied their right to work and their right to fair payment," Ramesh said in a statement.
        
        The Congress leader who served as the Union rural development minister in the UPA-2 government, said that in January 2024, the rural development ministry mandated the nationwide implementation of <mark>Aadhaar-Based Payment System (ABPS)</mark> for the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS).
        
        To be eligible for ABPS, workers must meet several conditions, including linking Aadhaar to their job card with the name matching in both, and mapping the Aadhaar-seeded bank account with the <mark>National Payments Corporation of India</mark>, he said.
        "Ten months later, we now have data on the catastrophic impact of this policy shift," he alleged.
        As per an analysis of the public data available on the MGNREGA portal by Lib Tech, a consortium of academics and activists, 27.4 per cent of all registered workers (6.7 crore) and 4.2 per cent of active workers (54 lakh) remain ineligible for ABPS, Ramesh claimed.
        "More worryingly, between April and September this year, 84.8 lakh workers registered under the MGNREGS found their names deleted from the programme.

"This deletion coincides with the implementation of ABPS, and so far, estimates suggest that at least 15 per cent of these deletions were wrongful," Ramesh said.

According to the Congress leader, ABPS-related issues and deletions may be impacting MGNREGA as a whole.

Also, the person days (total number of workdays a person registered under the programme completes in a financial year) generated in MGNREGA have fallen 16.6 per cent since last year, he claimed.

Noting that the ABPS comes in conjunction with the National Mobile Monitoring System (NMMS), he said both these policies are resulting in the violation of the right to work on demand and the right to timely payment of wages guaranteed under the MGNREGA.
